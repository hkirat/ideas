# Ideas
 - Detoxify - Give access to your user account. Surf their YT with a lot of content in whatever niche they want their feed to turn into. Revoke access by the end. $5 per surf.
 - PostMaster - Give me an idea/concept/your thought. Postmaster generates draft content for all your Social media handles, considering the intricate nuances of each social app, like max. limit, whats hot, Suitable Thumbnail, etc. Maybe, link your social handles and post directly from PostMaster after verifying the draft.
