# Ideas
 - Detoxify - Give access to your user account. Surf their YT with a lot of content in whatever niche they want their feed to turn into. Revoke access by the end. $5 per surf.
 - MetaTube - Give access to your user account. User uploads YT video as private, unlisted. App accesses the video using [YT API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/uploading_a_video), generates title, description, Video thumbnail, chapters, subtitles, etc. Charge X$ per request.
